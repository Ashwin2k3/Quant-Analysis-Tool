# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis with Streamlit

This project is a Stock Market Sentiment Analysis tool built using `Streamlit`, `yfinance`, `requests`, and `TextBlob`. It analyzes real-time news articles related to specific companies, performs sentiment analysis, and generates a buy/sell/hold signal based on the sentiments.

## Features

- **Fetch company-specific news** using the News API.
- **Perform sentiment analysis** on the fetched news articles using TextBlob.
- **Generate trading signals** (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on sentiment analysis results.
- **Select stock ticker** from a global dataset and analyze relevant news.
